### Deployment 

To view the timer challenge please follow this link https://d0g3bl2.github.io/tpx_impact_challenge_fac26/ to the github pages.

### Part one - reproduce a poster.

- Inside the [poster_challenge](https://github.com/d0g3bl2/tpx_impact_challenge_fac26/tree/main/poster_challenge) directory is `poster.html` which is linked to `poster.css` found in the `css` directory

- This reproduction of a poster advertising a Josef Muller-Brockmann concert (original image below) was a very enjoable take home challenge set by TPXimpact and uses css `grid`, as well a `position: relative;`, `box-shadow`, `text-shadow` and other CSS declarations.

- Since the original poster was very old and had discoloured over time I tried to give my reproduction a slightly worn look by making the text colour transparent and adding a `text-shadow` with 0 values for the x and y offsets and a small blur radius of `1.5px`

### Part two - Create a functioning stopwatch.

- Inside the [root directory](https://github.com/d0g3bl2/tpx_impact_challenge_fac26) is `index.html` which is linked to `timer.css` and `index.js`.
- The timer allows the user to start, stop and reset the time as well as render lap times into the UI which are stored in local storage as well as clearing local storage should they wish. The timer is responsive in mobile and desktop enviroments using

`@media only screen and (max-width: 750px) {
.controls {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
    }`

### User Stories

I broke the timer challenge down into the following user stories to get a clear idea of the different steps.

- The user wants to view a time display ‚úîÔ∏è 
- The current elapsed time should be in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds) ‚úîÔ∏è
- Start button: A button to start or continue a timer. ‚úîÔ∏è
- Pause button: A button to pause the running timer. ‚úîÔ∏è
- Reset button: A button to reset the timer to zero. ‚úîÔ∏è
- Lap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed. ‚úîÔ∏è
- Clear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history ‚úîÔ∏è
