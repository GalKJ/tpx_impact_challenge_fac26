### Part one - reproduce a poster.

- Inside the [poster_challenge](https://github.com/d0g3bl2/tpx_impact_challenge_fac26/tree/main/poster_challenge) directory is `poster.html` which is linked to `poster.css` found in the `css` directory

- This reproduction of a poster advertising a Josef Muller-Brockmann concert (original image below) was a very enjoable take home challenge set by TPXimpact and uses css `grid`, as well a `position: relative;`, `box-shadow`, `text-shadow` and other CSS declarations.
